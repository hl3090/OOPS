oops : object oriented programmming system

1) class : class is a collection of data member and member functions
          class is a datatype

2) object : object is an instance or variable of class

note: class always declare with class keyword.

syntax:

class <classname>:
     body of class

---------------------------

3) Encapsulation -: a class which wrap different data member and member functionin in a single
               entity.

     variables = state   // initial state
     methods = behaviour  // change color

     getter and setter -:   

     setter - it set something
     getter - it get something   


     security = constraints

     there are 3 access specifiers:

     public : which can access by own class and outside the class
     private : which is access by own class it is represents by __varname. 
     protected : which can access by own class and child class.. it is represents by
                  (_varname).  


-------------------------------------------------------

4) Inheritance -: One class derived properties to another class.

     using of Inheritance we can reduce our code which is provide reusability

     using of Inheritance we can save our time

     there are 5 types of Inheritance:

     1) single-level 
     2) multi-level
     3) multiple Inheritance
     4) hierarchical Inheritance
     5) hybrid Inheritance
  
   Hybrid Inheritance:
           
            combination of multiple and hierarchical Inheritance

                              A
                              |
                    --------------------
                    |                  |
                    B                  C 
                    |                  |
                    --------------------
                             |
                             D     


5) Polymorphism: poly means many morphism means forms 

               one named has different different forms its called as Polymorphism..

               Polymorphism which is derived from greek word 

               one named method has different form its called Polymorphism...
               e.g.-:
                      women has different types of roles-:
                            - wife
                            - sister
                            - mother
                            - employee

     It contain 2 methods:
     1) method overloading (compile time Polymorphism)
     2) method overriding (run time Polymorphism)
